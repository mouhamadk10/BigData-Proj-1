The wind blew softly, softly over the hills, and the hills echoed the wind.
Trees swayed, swayed gently, their leaves whispering, whispering secrets of the day.
The river ran, ran slowly, carrying reflections, carrying memories.
Birds sang, sang songs that danced in the air, songs that mingled with the wind, songs that mingled with the trees.
Night fell, fell quietly, quietly covering the land in shadows.
Stars appeared, appeared one by one, shining, shining like tiny flames, like tiny reminders of the day.
Silence settled, settled over the hills, over the river, over the trees, wrapping everything in calm.
The wind moved again, moved softly, moved through the trees, moved over the river, moved over the hills.
And in that moment, the hills, the river, the trees, the stars, and the wind all seemed to breathe, breathe together, breathe together in perfect, perfect harmony.
